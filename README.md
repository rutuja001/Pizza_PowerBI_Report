I created a Power BI report where I explained how to analyze data step by step. We started by bringing in raw data and using SQL to get important information. 
I showed how to make charts for trends, sales by category and size, and identify the best and worst performers. 
I also introduced Power BI, connected it to a database, and used Power Query to clean the data. 
The report includes building key performance indicators, processing data, and creating insightful charts. 
Towards the end, I demonstrated making a dashboard for the best and worst sellers with easy-to-use buttons.
